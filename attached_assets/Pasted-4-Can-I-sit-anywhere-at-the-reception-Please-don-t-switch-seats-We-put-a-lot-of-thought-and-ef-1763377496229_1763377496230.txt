4. Can I sit anywhere at the reception?

Please don’t switch seats! We put a lot of thought and effort into the seating plan to make sure everyone’s comfortable and seated with friends or people with similar interests.
Our coordinators will help you find your assigned seat after registration — just ask, and they’ll be happy to assist!


May I invite a “PLUS ONE” to the event?

We'd love to welcome everyone, but due to limited space, we're keeping our celebration intimate. As our event operates on an exclusive RSVP basis, we kindly ask that only the names listed on the invitation join us. We sincerely appreciate your understanding, which helps us ensure a comfortable and enjoyable celebration for all.


5. Can I bring someone else if my plus one or household member can’t make it?

We totally understand that plans can change! However, invitations are reserved for the guests listed. If your plus one or household member can't make it, please reach out to us— we'll gladly assist you from there.


6. Can I bring my kids during the event?

To ensure everyone can relax and fully enjoy our celebration of love, our wedding will be an adults-only occasion. However, children from our immediate families and wedding parties will be warmly welcomed.


7. I said “NO” to the RSVP but my schedule cleared up and I can attend now! What should I do?

Kindly message us first — your spot may have been given to another guest, but we’ll be happy to check if there’s still room for you to celebrate with us!

8. If seats become available, we will let you know as soon as possible.

Please refrain from attending without prior confirmation, as we may not have available seating.


9. Will there be parking available?

Yes! Parking will be available at both the ceremony and reception venues. Kindly note that spaces are on a first-come, first-served basis, so we encourage guests to arrive early. Please follow the signage and staff directions upon arrival to help ensure a smooth parking experience for everyone.


10. When is the appropriate time to leave?

Your presence with us is the most precious gift we could receive. We warmly invite you to stay and celebrate with us throughout the entire reception program. If you must leave early, we would be grateful for the chance to thank you personally and bid you farewell. We kindly ask, however, that you consider remaining until after our Thanksgiving Speech.
